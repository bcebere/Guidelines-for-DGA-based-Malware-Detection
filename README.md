## Repository structure
This repository is organized as follows:
```bash

src/
    |- dga_analysis/                        # Library containing models and benchmarks
      |- datasets/                          # Dataloaders for benign and DGA datasets
      |- detection/                         # Reference detection models
      |- generators/                        # Custom generators models
      |- utils/                             # Statistical and benchmarking tools
experiments/                                # Scripts and notebooks for generating the results in the paper
tests/                                      # Library unit tests
```

## Install
``` Bash
pip install -e .
pip install -e .[testing] # for the development setup
```

## Get the datasets
